here is a summary of how to use the bot:

How to Use the Discord Bot
Setup: Before you can use the bot, you need to set it up. This involves installing the discord.py library, creating a bot on the Discord Developer Portal, and getting your bot's unique token. For security, the bot is configured to read this token from an environment variable named DISCORD_TOKEN.

Permissions: To function correctly, the bot requires the "Manage Messages" permission in the Discord server. The user who is trying to use the clear command also needs this permission. If either the bot or the user lacks this permission, the command will not work, and a message will be sent to the channel explaining the issue.

Command: The command to clear messages is !a34 clear [quantity].

!a34: This is the command prefix.

clear: This is the specific action to perform.

[quantity]: This is a placeholder for the number of messages you want to delete. You must replace this with a positive whole number. For example, to clear 10 messages, you would type !a34 clear 10.

Functionality: When the command is executed, the bot will first delete the command message itself. Then, it will delete the specified number of messages from the channel. A confirmation message will be sent to the channel for 5 seconds before being automatically deleted. If you enter an invalid quantity (e.g., text instead of a number, or a negative number), the bot will send an error message.
